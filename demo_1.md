Let's come up with a plan for the following problem...
```
We'll say that a positive int divides itself if every digit in the number divides into the number evenly. So for example 128 divides itself since 1, 2, and 8 all divide into 128 evenly. 

And we'll say that 0 does not divide into anything evenly, so no number with a 0 digit divides itself. 

Write a function to determine if a number divides itself.
